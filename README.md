## About me
I'm currently studying computer science at the IUT of Blagnac with the goal of specializing in development, particularly in artificial intelligence. This field excites me because it opens incredible possibilities for the future of technology.

Besides my studies, I'm passionate about video games—especially souls-likes and metroidvanias—and I'm a dedicated chess player. I love tackling complex challenges whether on a chessboard or in a demanding game. These activities constantly stimulate my strategic mind.

## Projects
**Professional project: AI development**

My current plan is to continue my studies and pursue a master's degree in AI. I'm especially interested in applications of artificial intelligence for data processing, automation and creating intelligent systems.

**Personal projects**
- **Video game development (Dungeon Crawler on Roblox):** I'm working on a dungeon crawler game on the Roblox platform. This combines my passion for creating games with technological innovation.
- **FIDE Master title:** As a chess player, I aim to obtain the FIDE Master title. This goal requires constant practice, competitions and strong strategic skills.
- **Vtubing on Twitch:** I'm also interested in Vtubing to stream chess games on Twitch. This project is still in the planning phase but I hope to start soon to combine my passion for chess and streaming.
